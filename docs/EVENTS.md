# EVENTS

The communication inside and outside the _phone-island_ is made through the [Event interface](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Event).

During the initialization some event listeners are attached to the `window` object.

To trigger the events it is therefore necessary to dispatch events on the `window` object.

Events dispatch can be done using the [CustomEvent constructor](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CustomEvent/CustomEvent).

## Usage

### Helper Function

The following is an example of helper function that can be used to dispatch events, the target can be any object but it uses `window` by default.

```javascript
/**
 * The helper function
 *
 * @param name The name of the event
 * @param data The data object
 * @param element The target element
 */
export const eventDispatch = (
  name: string,
  data: any,
  element: HTMLElement | Window = window,
) => {
  typeof element !== 'undefined'
    ? element.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent(name, { detail: data }))
    : console.error(new Error('EventDispatch error: element is not defined'))
}

// Call the helper function
eventDispatch('phone-island-call-start', { number: '212' })
```

As you can see, the helper function can be used in the following way:

`eventDispatch('<event-name>', '<data-object>')`

### Complete Vanilla JavaScript Integration Example

For a complete, working example showing how to integrate phone-island events in a vanilla JavaScript application, see:

**üìÅ [widget-example/index.html](../widget-example/index.html)** - Complete HTML integration example with UI  
**üìÅ [widget-example/index.js](../widget-example/index.js)** - JavaScript event handling and integration logic

This example demonstrates:

1. **Event Dispatching**: How to send commands to phone-island
2. **Event Listening**: How to receive notifications from phone-island  
3. **Complete Integration**: Real-world buttons and status updates
4. **Utility Functions**: Ready-to-use functions for common operations
5. **Token Configuration**: How to properly configure the phone-island widget
6. **Real-time Event Log**: Visual feedback for all phone-island events
7. **Error Handling**: Status updates and console logging for debugging

**üöÄ Quick Start:**
1. Replace `YOUR_BASE64_ENCODED_TOKEN_HERE` with your actual Base64 encoded token
2. Open `widget-example/index.html` in your browser
3. Use the buttons to test integration with phone-island
4. Monitor the event log and console for real-time feedback

**üéØ Key Features:**
- Interactive UI with all major phone-island controls
- Real-time status updates and event logging
- Theme switching (light/dark)
- WebRTC device management
- Call controls (start, end, mute, hold, transfer)
- Debugging utilities and status information
